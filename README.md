# Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of Rust language proficiency through the development of a web scraping tool. The software is designed to fetch HTML content from a user-provided URL and allow selection of specific elements using CSS selectors.

The purpose of this software is twofold: firstly, to showcase my understanding of Rust syntax and concepts, and secondly, to provide a practical utility for extracting information from web pages efficiently.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using Rust programming language, leveraging the following tools and libraries:

- **Rust**: A systems programming language known for its performance, reliability, and productivity.
- **reqwest**: A robust HTTP client library for Rust, used for sending GET requests to fetch web page content.
- **scraper**: A Rust library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data using CSS selectors.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites proved to be valuable resources:

- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Reqwest Documentation](https://docs.rs/reqwest/)
- [Scraper Documentation](https://docs.rs/scraper/)

# Future Work

In the future, the following improvements and additions could be considered:

- Enhance error handling to provide more informative messages to users.
- Implement support for more advanced CSS selectors.
- Add functionality to save scraped data to a file for later analysis.
- Improve performance by optimizing the web scraping process.
- Incorporate multithreading to parallelize the scraping tasks for increased efficiency.
